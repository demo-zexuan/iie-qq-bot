"""Resilience test: OOM Killed container behavior.

Purpose: Verify the system correctly handles runtimes killed due to memory limits.

Scenario:
1. Create a sandbox using a profile with limited memory (e.g., 128MB).
2. Execute code that attempts to allocate more memory than allowed.
3. Verify the runtime is killed by OOM and the sandbox status remains accessible.
4. Optionally verify the exit code indicates OOM.

Note: This test requires a profile with strict memory limits.
      If such profile doesn't exist, the test will be skipped.

Parallel-safe: Yes - each test creates/deletes its own sandbox.
