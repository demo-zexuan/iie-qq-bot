"""Global HTTP client manager for Bay.

Provides a shared httpx.AsyncClient with connection pooling for
efficient HTTP communication with Ship containers.

Benefits:
- Connection reuse across requests (avoids TCP/TLS handshake per request)
- Configurable connection pool limits
- Automatic lifecycle management via FastAPI lifespan
- Reduced memory footprint under high concurrency
